# DNA-Mutation-Detection
A Python-based project for detecting and analyzing mutations in DNA sequences.   This tool helps identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), insertions, and deletions by comparing reference and sample DNA data.

## Features
- Detects mutations between reference and test DNA sequences
- Supports multiple sequence inputs
- Highlights mismatches, insertions, and deletions
- Easy-to-use, lightweight, and extendable

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Biopython (if used)
- String/sequence comparison algorithms

## Installation
``bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/DNA_mutation_detections.git
cd DNA_mutation_detections
pip install -r requirements.txt``
## Usage
bash
Copy code
python mutation_detector.py reference.fasta sample.fasta
## Example Output
yaml
Copy code
Reference: ATCGTACGATCG
Sample:    ATGGTACCATCG
Mutations detected:
- Position 3: C → G
- Position 8: G → C
## Future Work
Integration with genomic datasets

Visualization of mutation hotspots

Support for large FASTA/FASTQ files
